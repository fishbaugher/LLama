Bathrobe

I'm sitting in my bathrobe ruminating
On all the things to do today.
I'm sure that I can fit it all in
If I just think of it the right way.
Probably planning is half the battle,
I don't intend to be defeated.
But my energy stores and brain capacity
Seem to be completely depleted.
I'm not sure where I can find more,
So I'd better be alone,
So I can check social media
And spend hours on my phone.
I'll get to the tasks once I know how,
Surely Facebook can be of assistance
I'm trying to govern my tweeting and snapping
And I'm also leading the resistance.
The day goes by as I sit here,
Lost in the robot world of persuasion.
It's like all of the thoughts that were so clear
Lost to this information invasion.
Sometimes the best way to get things done 
Is to sit quietly and plan first.
Sometimes sitting with robot in hand,
Leaves problems of time at their worst.
