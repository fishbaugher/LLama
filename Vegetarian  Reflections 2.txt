Vegetarian Reflections 2

I used to think that eating chicken was a moral meat to chew,
I mean, even chickens think that's fine, they eat chicken too
til Amy heard my poem summing up my past views on conscious dinner
And I knew that I had been so wrong, though I'd sure been no sinner.
See, she told of creatures who get caught in nets they could fit through
Who look at you in the deli aisle with as must zest as live ones do
I remembered as my kiddo learned to throw back those too small
That even a fish who just got hooked has learned nothing at all
I knew immediately she was right, and that I could for sure eat fish 
These creatures made the intellect of chickens a distant wish
I still feel okay about the chicken I eat, but I finally talked to some cows.
And though dallas still regularly eats it, I dont have guilt free steak now.
