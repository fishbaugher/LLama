Thanks Heart

Having feet is nice because I get to walk around. 
Having ears is nice when I hear a lovely sound.
Having teeth is good for greeting people with a smile.
And digits on my hand make phone calls easier to dial.
Having lungs is cool cause I require so much air.
And these eyeballs of mine are great for an early morning stare.
Arms are nice for hugging and for whacking that baseball
Shoulders great for confused shrugging when I don't know at all.
Knees are cool, cause walking without them would be rough,
And hips are great for carrying around babies and their stuff.
Brains are nice for math and learning right from the very start.
Also I get to love and have blood flow, so thank you heart.
