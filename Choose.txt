Choose

Some stories end by giving up
As the choice is always there.
But just because you can give up
Doesn't mean it leads anywhere.

Great heroes in the books we read 
Don't lack an incredible fight.
The thing that makes them heroes
Is the not tiring of doing what's right.

The weight of the world is heavy,
And when it seems to break your chances,
Grab it by the hand, I say, 
You'll find even that weight dances.

There's beauty all around the world.
And there's evil everywhere too.
The blessing of free will is why
You choose which ones for you.
