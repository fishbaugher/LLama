Feet

Tarsals and their metas, and their nasty phalanges too.
Are part of human anatomy that's better hidden in a shoe.
The skin always cracking, and toes always jamming,
Misshapen from half awake coffee table slamming,
Some have pointy nails, some thick and crumbling,
And thunderous ceiling sounds, compact living rumbling,
The smell's only nontoxic if good luck prevails,
They pollute beautiful beaches with gross human trails,

It's not like I'm just negative, I can be surprisingly sweet, 
unless I'm lost in all the disgustI feel, 
at the existence of human feet.
