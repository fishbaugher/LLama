Word

The truth is like the gold that's held 
Where we don't want to go
Because in the fight to get to it
Is what we don't know we don't know

Slaying dragons requires
an extremely scary trip to the cave
Some fearful parts may die on the way
And you choose the parts you save

And so when you meet the beast within, 
You're sharpened like a sword
And instead of a bloody battle
You slay him with the word.

L.L. Ama
