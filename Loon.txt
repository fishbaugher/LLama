Loon

If I don't want to be a loon,
But circumstances and genes predispose me;
I'll have to stop and look deep inside,
To see what musician I let compose me.

Is it voices of grace and truth
That I mindlessly follow around?
Do I heed disturbed emotional needs
That steer me into the ground?

Following and aiming at my own goals
While internally recording the progress,
Makes it easier to be honest and real
To lose myself in the flow of the process.

Life will go by if I'm living or not,
I can't stop time to introspect.
Just briefly check in with the goodness in me,
And make sure I'm doing what I would respect.
