Son

On this day for the last thirteen years,
I've had love move me to tears.
I've watched you be so often courageous
Through times both joyous and hellacious,
When I look back over the years I cry,
My heart overflows and leaks from my eye.
You're more than my best hopes imagined,
And when life is ready to be examined,
The best parts of mine were because of you,
Your mom is the best thing I am and do.
Some times are hard, and others fun.
All of them better because you're my son.
