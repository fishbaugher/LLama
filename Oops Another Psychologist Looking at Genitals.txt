Oops Another Psychologist Looking at Genitals.

A baby comes out knowing nothing except for how to suck. 
And nurses teach about that tiny throat where things get stuck.
It lasts until the little one is 12 months to 18,
So keep choking hazards out of reach and coffee tables clean.

Then the kiddo notices they're a separate thing from you
And you start to get distressed about the places he goes poo
The kid is super excited by the process of elimination
By three he graduates by finding toilets, delaying gratification

Then the kids begin to notice differences in their plumbing 
And penis envy is a trait to which the females are succumbing.
They fantasize about their parents and feel ashamed cuz that is weird
And graduate to identifying with the same sex parent by 6 years.

They move into the latent stage and repress their sexy urges
Point themselves to productive stuff for constant energy purges
This last till right around 12 years, when the puberty bursts out
And then they move to genitals, which I'll tell you about.

From puberty to grown up good the genitals are the focus
If you're getting pleasure sexually those things will be the locus
But thankfully at this point we look to people outside of our kin
And so the infant ID becomes ego (till the superego wins) (and the merry-goes-round again)
