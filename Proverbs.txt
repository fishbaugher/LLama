Proverbs

The hardest task to finish is the one you haven’t started.
Keep your eggs in more than one basket.
If you’re willing and you know it, praise the Lord.
Always remember to never forget.
If it is not the same, then it is probably different.
Use words to talk.
Shame is a bad thing. Do not have it.
Smell the cake. Blow out the candles.
If you feel nothing, move in a proximal direction.
Do not wait until you are doing great to be grateful.
If you want to be flexible, be willing to stretch.
Excuses are not great motivators. Use reasons instead.
If you must do it, may as well learn to like it.
Do not believe everything you think.
Say “Oh my God, I am so stressed out right now”, and you won’t be as stressed out right then.
Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to stupidity.
If you are the only one who won, you lost.
Dogs eat their vomit. Do not be like them. Leave it and go on.
If you are always right, you are not paying attention.
If you wanna be where you need to be, be where you are.
The field gets plowed more quickly if you dangle carrots for the mule.
If you do not give the mule the carrot when the field is plowed, it will not be so quick next time.
To be human is to be vulnerable. To accept that is to transcend your mortal existence.
Find something worth moving, and carry it up a hill.
If you work all day raking leaves, jump in the pile.
Be yourself, everyone else is already taken. 
Do something for someone who cannot repay you. Don’t rush through it.
