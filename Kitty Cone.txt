Kitty Cone

Oysef is a kitty who has had a long hard day.
Requiring lots of money that his human had to pay.

After being wounded in the middle of the night
And rushed to er vet while I cried tears at kitty's plight

He was seen shaved and sedated and we had to leave him there
And when we picked him up there was a cone for him to wear.

But Oy has too much dignity to bear the cone of shame.
With that thing on he's wild and there's no chance he'll e'r be tame.

So instead he wears a onesie so he doesnt eat his stiches.
And though his discontent is shown each time his tail twitches,

He likes it more than the cone of Shame the surgeon had provided
But you can see this onesie wearer is still far from delighted.
