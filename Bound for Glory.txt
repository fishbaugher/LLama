Bound for Glory

So, it sounds your story's end is close enough to welcome you 

To hospice. And to magic. For there's quite a lot to you. 

We're gonna keep your body just as quiet as we can. 

We hope to keep your mind at ease, so let the chaplain in. 

We'll help you & your loved ones come to terms and come to peace; 

This may include some desperate screams towards heaven from our knees 

You can be just terrified think you don't have what it takes 

That's the whole reason we exist! That is normal, for God's sake! 

Or! you can be excited cause your God and family's calling you 

Well help you wrap up any unfinished tasks you've left to do 

So smell the cake .
Blow out the candles.
Give yourself a break. 

Each day you wake,
Well help you handle
That day's head or heartache. 

We'll be there even if you tell us we all suck and truly stink. 

If you only let a nurse come once a week, we'll come, but I think 

It's important that you know you won't get all we have to give 

In these precious days you are still here, and still can choose to live 

We here at hospice are a team and that's not by mistake 

Let all of us in and see what we have to offer, for your sake. 

Your life and your death are sacred.  Your loves light can shine on 

Long after your failing body stops it's efforts and is gone 

These memories we make now are as sacred as your story 

Let's finish this last chapter, and get you where you're bound;  to glory
