Sunshine

What a lot of sunshine,
Just a few sequens can bring.
It turns the ranshaked hobble
To the throne where sits the king

What a lot of smiles,
Just a few sung notes can hold.
All grays and yellowed whites do turn
To bold rainbowed and gold

What a lot of woes walk off
With just a kind whispered word
So when you walk away from folks,
Make sure that's what they've heard.
