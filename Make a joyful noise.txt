Make a joyful noise

O, God! To have a soul again that sings!
That smiles to greet the storm clouds up above.
Knowing that both beauty and chaos it brings
Me a feather caught up in winds of your love 

I want to convince the lesser part of me who needs excuse,
That what whirls and roars with thunder, striking to the ground 
Is the creator of my soul's withering songs, without refuse
Like this storm's what makes my soul's songs lose their sound 

But maybe I rehearse instead, who you have been to me
Those moments yours and mine, where I saw what I can't see. 
When I needed no faith to help me believe my unbelief 
When I heard you love me in the wind that whooshes through the trees 

Lord, help me remember that you do not see it shame
That I must have song on my lips to dare to speak your name 
I forgot to sing to only you, O lover of my soul!
But you keep reminding and reminding and reminding all the same 
Make a joyful noise to God and let your heart be full!
