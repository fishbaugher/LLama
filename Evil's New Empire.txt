Evil's New Empire

They told us that faith wasnt needed as we proceeded to our seats.
They said all the wonder was no thing to ponder but something  that science completes.

They said do not worry about a soul as we hurry, anxious through each year
We're here for the pleasure and all earthly treasure, and then we disappear.

They said we are good as is and should not feel obliged to  make change
They said prop up teachers,  or be groped by preachers, sights should be short range

They said what is true is to see people as groups and in all that we do be inclusive
And There're plenty of pills if our consciousness ills or gets boldly intrusive.


They said we dont need a savior or to change our behavior to try to do whats right.
Just  be only meat with curiosity beat, too afraid to speak truth to our plight

They said that a dog who has spewed up his dinner's no sinner if he returns to the pile
The said  believe every story of rape, no escape and no need for justice or trial.

They say women wed men have kids then pretend they're happy when they're not.
They say each cops racism inspired what's fired as innocent black kids are shot. 

They say if anger erupts it's not us that corrupts, and we have no control
That only those who engage each feeling of rage are ever truly whole

They say finding peace is for wobbly knees, archaic and outdated
What we truly need is to make sure our greed and desires are all satiated

And then we can not bring ourselves to get up out of bed
We need a million medications or we are full of dread
We need safe spaces cause we cant feel without it being overwhelming 
disagreement has costs that make conformity to insanity compelling

What a perfect time for wolves and tyrants hungry for lost sheep
Who promise safety for our freedom if we'll just stay asleep

Who needs  God ? big brothers got his all seeing google eye on you.
We forgot a price was paid so we could dare to say what's true
We chose instead to align with the beast that rendered us unable 
As add more new steps of ego and pride on this new age tower of babel
