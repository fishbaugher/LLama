Candy

Candy tastes so yummy
And so does soda pop
Nothing like using a fizzy drink
To dip your lollipop.

Baby bottle pops and coating
Fun dips, Skittles, starburst.
The taste buds shout hooray
As attention declines to its worst.

Pancake syrup, cotton candy,
And all other kinds of treat,
Make your belly full and swollen,
Though you've no real thing to eat.

It you want a car to run well,
You don't fill the tank with bleach.
And filling people up with sugar's
As illogical to teach.

Bleach is great for bleaching,
In the gas tank it is just sad.
Sugars great for bursts of energy
But the dentist tastes so bad.
