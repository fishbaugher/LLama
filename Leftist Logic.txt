Leftist Logic

If the world is the cause,
And how I feel is effect,
Then it's easy to see
At birth I was perfect.

All bad thoughts I have,
Have been put from outside,
From environments I dont
Control but by which I abide.

So if I cuss while I'm driving,
Or scream and yell at my kid
And you think you can ask
Why I did what I did,

I'll call your attention to 
The ease of your life
Compared to inconsolable me,
Whose had naught but strife

And remind you again
How just askings unfair
And burdens me by hearing
To the point of despair.

I'm not where to look
For explanations of me
Look instead to the cosmos
That caused me to be.

Blame existence instead,
From where suffering flows,
Casualties scattered,
Wherever it grows,

See, the world we exist in
Causes what we then do,
But dont trigger me somehow,
Cause then I'll blame YOU

See I'm a blank slate
That life grips in its tyranny
You may be one too,
till you trigger me
