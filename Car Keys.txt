Car Keys

Car keys, car keys, always hiding from me.
Never sitting where I know I'm sure they should be.
Needed for the ride, and knowing that they're needed
They make me look all over cause they're just so conceded 
Are you on the key hook, no! What about my purse?
Are you on the bathroom counter, in my bed, or even worse
Have you been put in the laundry? The load that's going now? 
Fine, I'll go without you, just as soon as I know how.
