Unmedicated Anxiety

I dont like anxiety, but I still must admit
Without it I'm nor sure I'd do much more than sit.
I dont like being bossed around by voices of my worry,
But if they never spoke at all I'd never know to hurry.
Sometimes it serves no purpose but to drive me up the wall,
Other times it let's me know there're cliffs so I dont fall.
It isn't needed all the places it consistently persists,
Yet sometimes is the only sign if trouble that exists.
Some days anxiety is a bear trap catching purpose it its claws
Sometimes it serves to do no thing but point out all my flaws.
I wouldn't rid me of it though, even if I could
Cause it also directs my attention when I fail to do what I should.
Sometimes I wake up all alone and must get out of bed,
Sometimes I forget I am a body which requires being fed,
Those times anxiety is a function used to keep me alive and well,
And I'd rather let anxiety ride along than drive myself to hell.
