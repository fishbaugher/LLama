What does success look like?

Success looks like a peaceful death,
knowing life has not been wasted.
Knowing chances were not overlooked, 
and life was more than tasted.

Success is living truthfully, 
and friends around your bed.
It is laughter in between them,
A cold washcloth on your head.

Success is children who don't fear
the future without you.
Who stand up straight with shoulders back,
and know they'll make it through.

It is being able to let go,
With no business left unfinished,
As the grip on this world slows
And your heartbeat is diminished.

It is seeing heaven in the clouds, 
your flight becoming fervent
And the voice that calls and says
well done, my good and faithful servant.
