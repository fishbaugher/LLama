Decide

It is not important what facts you learn and repeat till they're memorized.
It matters that you know how to find them yourself and tell the truth from lies.
If all you know is what you've been taught by others, you dont belong to you.
You can only remember what others assembled and decided for you was true.
If you cant make your own hope it can always be stolen by greed or one in need 
plan your own steps or you're vulnerable to goose steps and someone evil's creed
