Voices

What I am when all alone,
Is all that's really there.
I survive around a crowd,
But am only half aware.

Alone and awake I realize,
What's inside needs to mend.
I can distract and busy me,
But the good things are just pretend.

There's more to me than I can see
When my life's pace moves too swift.
And I avoid alone, cause I know
That my soul has begun to drift.

I know that when I'm finally quiet
The monsters will come to play.
They've been pushed out of my mind
Yet still they have so much to say.

They're mine, for me, no one can help
To quiet the voices inside.
And it's important to deal with them now
So they're not with me when I've died.

Alone can be so frightening,
Because I know I am truly not.
The answer to this problem isn't found 
If it isn't sought.

So I'll sit and let the voices roar,
Introduce them to truth out loud.
And let life on earth be more difficult,
So I can someday make someone proud.
