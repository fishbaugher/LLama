Vote

I'm going to vote for the next president,
Cause I'm sure that my vote will bring change.
I'd better complain about who I don't like,
And the hairdos that are frankly quite strange.
I'm so political, look at me! Voicing my opinions and shit.
And stupidly having confidence that I have any control over it.
