Clump of Cells

I was a clump of cells swift growing
Not yet from your belly showing

You loved me.

I was so bald there could be no bows
Mistaken for a boy in spite of pink clothes.

You loved me.

I was a big sister reading books upside down
And trilling on the car rides to town.

You loved me.

I was growing something out of my shoulder
I'd be a goose soon, and I knew that you'd hold her.

You loved me.

I got made fun of at school and cried
Stole food from the pantry and then lied.

You loved me. 

My skin was the canvas, a knife was my brush
I drew out my pain in a frenzied crazed rush.

You loved me.

I went through things I wouldn't dare say
I thought that the world had thrown me away.

You loved me.

I drank and drank to ease the pain
And in the process was rendered insane.

You loved me. 

I sobered up at seventeen
Because of my own clump too small to be seen.

You loved me.

I got so sick I could no longer fake it
Between drugs and anorexia I mightn't make it.

You loved me. 

I went to treatment and finally got clean
But to you I was cold and distant and mean.

You loved me.

I grew up enough to finally know it
I loved you but didn't know how to show it.

You loved me.

I reached out and you were there for me
I felt so ashamed for now I could see

I loved you. 

No matter what or how or where
I knew that my mom would always be there

I loved you.

I tried to think of a way to show it,
But I hope that, like me, it's so clear that you KNOW it.

I love you
