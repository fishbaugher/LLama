IDG

IDG is a biweekly chore,
That I'm not allowed to ignore.
As a new hospice nurse,
It feels much like a curse,
Can I just show myself to the door? 

IDG brings the team to the table.
Who is dead; who's declining; who's stable? 
If I'm late, use my note,
I sure hope that I wrote,
And I'll get there as soon as I'm able.


IDG is an all day affair.
I got places to be; I ain't there.
So I'll panic and stress.
Give my own family less.
Greeting you with my thousand yard stare.


Oh dear God! Have mercy on me!
Let me go IDG, set me free!
I don't want you to stay,
Eating up my whole day,
If faces mean much,  y'all agree.
