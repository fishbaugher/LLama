Berries

On my way back from berry picking
As the sun sank from the sky 
I was almost home when from behind
I heard a desperate cry

I looked that way and saw a man
Grizzled beard, unbuttoned shirt
Staggering, swaying on his feet
His eyes filled up with hurt

I took my headphones out and turned
focused on the shoeless guy
While he spoke all rushed and broken
Moved by his anguish to a cry

He said he was old and his back bent
And he couldn't use his phone
His eyesight and service had gone out
And he was all alone

He had just moved from the coast
And didn't have a friend
And couldn't stand the TV talking 
And he was at the end

He said that life could not go on
That he was contemplating suicide
He wanted so bad to be seen
But all he could do was hide.

He chattered on while I attempted
To get the broken phone to call
But I didn't know a way to fix it
And I was no help at all.

I sat on the grass while he sat in his car
And I offered him a smoke
As he told me of his troubles
when he was out of words I spoke

I said sir I am so sorry but this phone
Is broken past my skill
And I wanted ao much to help you
Say what I could do, I will!

He said oh, the phone, it slipped my mind
See that wasnt really so bad
You have helped, for weeks this is the
Only conversation that I've had

So I said goodbye and I went home
And put the berries away
I thought I was too broke to help anyone
Turns out attention's all I had to pay.
