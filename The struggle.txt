The struggle

The struggle that you wrestle with
Is not without purpose if you look.
Imagine you're the main character
In a thick unfinished book.
It might look like a tragedy
But if you've ever read for fun,
You know the theme cannot be
Certain till the book is done.
You were not a viewpoint character
For parts endured in your past,
But now the book is with you,
And you have the pen at last.

I hope you feel your heart beat
In your chest like a pounding drum
I hope you write adventures
And write you out getting some.

I love to read, and here and there
I'll pick on purpose tragedy,
But i prefer the conflict in a heart
Between to be or not to be.

So write it out, who you will be
And face the blank pages of your story
Decide for you if what the previous pages
Held will steal all glory.

And as your pen flies valiantly 
Across time left here for you,
You get at least the assurance
That you chose what you would do.
