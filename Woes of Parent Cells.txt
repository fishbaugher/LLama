Woes of Parent Cells

If you are the basic unit of life,
And you want to have a son,
I'm afraid no matter how hard you try,
It simply can't be done.

Somatic parents trying for boys
Love semi-conservative DNA replicators
They rush through prophase till centrioles appear,
And line chromosomes up at the equators.

But alas! And woe, to the non-sex cells,
As their single division reaches telophase.
For daughter cells are all they can make,
Though each begs and pleads and prays.

Not only do they get stuck with daughter cells,
But genetically identical twins.
And so a non-sex cell who dreams of sons,
Fights against the rules but never wins.

Sex cells try twice as hard for son's,
Splitting diploid to haploid to haploid.
But despite all efforts occurring in germlines,
Their parental dreams are always destroyed.

The chromosome number is halved in meiosis,
But still just makes daughter cells.
Crossing over and independent assortment
Create new combinations of alleles.

The process brings life, and makes babies for us,
The disappointment makes parent sex cells sick.
But though they are sonless, they might find relief,
Knowing half of them live by a dick.
