Rain Drop

I'm just a rain drop, I dont know I'm wet
Free falling towards puddles; the closer I get
The more that I wish for a wet suit to wear
The more I see my family drowning in there
The more I see to my horror what fate awaits me
Ache as I realize whoever made me must hate me
I am a raindrop, unique in my drop to ground
Where I lose all my boundaries and am instantly drowned.
