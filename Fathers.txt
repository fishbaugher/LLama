Fathers

Who made the stars 
And who created me?
They each have a similarly impactful role.
Both father's choose good in what they see,
And aid in shaping of their childrens souls.

A role as guide,
Faithful teacher.
Across universal size barrier reacher.
Sermon fuel, but no preacher,
Dirty play day white again bleacher
Always on my behalf beesecher.

We all need someone to look up to
And that's why God created you
