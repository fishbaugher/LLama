Comfort

Discomfort is the birth of action,
It demands that we attend it.
Our search begins to find the cause,
Which we label problem to be amended.

Comfort seems the goal we seek,
And carefully plan to achieve.
There's worth in it so valuable,
Or so we humans seem to believe 

But if discomfort drives change,
Then it's absence drives death,
We've achieved our own goal,
As growth takes it's last breath.

We all avoid the pain we can,
It naturally causes some fear.
But failure to acknowledge it's presence 
Doesn't make it disappear.

So we finally face the thing head on,
And struggle, our goal to be done.
To permanently quell it's effect on us
Get back to good times and fun.

How troublesome on the other side,
To discover discomforts galore.
It's like we're playing whack a mole,
Get one and here come three more.

How many more frightening exploratory trips?
How many more mountains to climb?
How many more embarrassing slips?
How much more of our precious time?

Alive in the true sense of the word,
Requires more than monotonous comfort.
Comfortable living as a religion,
Is more like a suicide than a sport.
