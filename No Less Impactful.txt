No Less Impactful

Like sea turtles who span centuries
drifting shore to shore
An oak that's spent as much time 
dropping his acorns galore,
Like Aristotle's politics or Newton's
thoughts on Gravity,
Like Beowulf, or Hamlet, or John
Donne's poem "the flea",
Like rocks or elephants or bonds
formed when goods are sold,
You're made no less impactful
now that You, like them, are old
