Planks

What draws one person to another?
Why attempt communication at all?
Sometimes the largest go ignored,
While we talk of the problems so small.

It's easy to be convinced beyond doubt,
That the other is your foe,
When you've already planned decisively 
How the conversation will go.

But still the contact is required,
So there's seeking out involved.
By people truly sure in their hearts,
Of who is guilty and who is absolved.

And so a short series of barking ensues,
Like when bad mastered street dogs meet. 
And they puff up their chests and try to look big,
To avoid the fight yet achieve the defeat.

Others doing it makes me giggle or run,
Depending on gender and size,
But also makes me wonder about
Communication shaped planks in my eyes.
