Born Again

I didn't know what wrong really was,
Until I decided to try to do right. 
Now I can see what being born again means,
And why wisdom's synonymous with sight.

It explains how to die as a sacrifice feels,
As each piece that is wrong is destroyed.
How else do you know how to choose painful paths,
As though they're somehow easily enjoyed?

It explains the phrase the weight of the world,
When you learn how to pay close attention.
Though I once felt boxed in, it's heavy to know
I've more chances and choices to mention.

Like small children awaiting filling up empty space
After losing that first little tooth,
I have faith something better is already planned,
There's a way to shine the light on the truth.
