Up to you

What has sunshine got to do with the roses?
What have shoes and socks to do with all your little toeses?

What has a peel to do with all the fruit inside bananas?
What do our parents have to do 
With poppas and our nanas?

What have we to do with all the things we see to do?
Protect the you that's little being
Kind and true to you.

Let yourself get bigger and don't forget to learn.
Listen to instruction, and talk when it's your turn.

Do all the things that you know how, expand it when you can.
Practice what's right in private, so you've less efforts to your plan.

The world is vast and wonderful
Go marvel at its treasures.
But track your aims and soul,
And don't lose you to it's pleasures.

For you're here for a reason,
I'd tell it to you if I knew.
But your future, like your view on life,
You'll find is up to you.
