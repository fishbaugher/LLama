The Wrath of Grapes

What there among the fruit in lines,
Hides from the birds with nets and vines?
A bunch of skins hold juice and seeds.
With wrathful thoughts and wicked deeds.
They stew in their juicy angry silence,
till brix and wrath intice our violence.
On that day the first light coffee drinkers,
Set out to harvest the plump evil thinkers.
We strip them of their protective covers,
And rip them from their natural mothers.
Their plots are foiled thanks to the apes,
Who sit and drink the wrath of grapes.
