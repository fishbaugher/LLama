Problems

A problem is a problem till a bigger one appears
Going deaf is envied by the one who has no ears
Weeding the garden is a problem for one who has a yard
And overdrawn accounts for ones who have a debit card.
Rent is only trouble to the ones who live in there,
And grown out roots dont bother chemo patients with no hair.
Smelly shoes are only for the ones with shoes at all,
Shut off phones are problems when there's folks that you can call.
Screaming babies never bother those who can't give birth,
Starving people never worry at the expansion of their girth.
The things you own are valuable until the house burns to the ground.
After that you're thankful just to breathe and be around.
