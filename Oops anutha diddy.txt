Oops Anutha Diddy

Behold the brand new nurses as they take it to the floor,
With no one there to quiz them during med pass anymore. 
What you can see of their faces doesn't give away their fear
They PURCHASED years of torture, while their kids grew to get here

When they started they did not know here would be so bleak
That they'd steady shaking hands to help anyone who's weak
Maybe they did not know they'd be training with the guard
That they'd be fed and walk by planted thank you's in the yard.
Maybe they did not foresee the mask and shield and gown
Would be a part of time management while trying not to drown.

They surely didn't know they'd be the new pandemic nurses, 
But what could have been accepted as goal ending cosmic curses


Was faced with force and passion no SARS surge could destroy
They met it with brave tenderness and managed to bring joy
They did not run from hard work or try to numb away the pain
They just held out their umbrella and stood with you in the rain.

They set out to be assets, and help communities in need
Their dedication in this town is why we will succeed.
