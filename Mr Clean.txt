Mr Clean

Before you turn the light off
It's smart to look around.
And make sure laundrys in the basket,
Instead of laying on the ground.

If you don't love wafting moldy smells,
And you just showered or bathed,
White side up over showers door,
Is how the bath mat is saved.

The towels, washcloths, and toilet paper,
Can be found in the same place.
If you don't notice right away,
Look for glass cabinents and turn your face.

Remember that while drying off,
You're clean if you did it right.
So you can use the towel several times 
Before the washer is it's plight.

The laundry in the basket, you'll find,
Gets washed, dried, and returned to you.
Which beats the nagging if left on the floor,
You may have to suffer through.

A thought on mirrors and counters here,
I think you know what I mean,
They function best for everyone,
When they're uncluttered and clean.

Toilet activity sometimes is standing
But also sometimes sitting.
Please put down the lid so no one
Gets a dunked behind unwitting.

In order to make that easy, 
You'll find cleaners beneath the sink.
And if we all do our best to participate,
We'll get along so much better, I think!
