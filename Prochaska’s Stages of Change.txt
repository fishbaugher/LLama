Prochaska’s Stages of Change

If you want to know how hard it is to truly change a habit,
Tell you “You don’t get any cake”, then watch you as you grab it.
So if you won’t even listen to yourself when deciding what to do,
To help another we need evidence based models to work through.
In the first stage of change you’ll notice a great lack of motivation,
Defensive if confronted, as he’s in the stage pre-contemplation.
If you give information, and he throws pamphlets in the air,
You’ll know that though you’re willing, your patient’s not yet there.
Then he may get ambivalent, and waver back and forth,
Weighing the pros and cons and deciding what change’s worth.
You can listen actively, let him not know if he will change or not.
Therapeutically communicate, elicit change talk, it’s worth a shot.
Move with him to preparation and identification of the snares;
A heart attack is worse than judgy beefed up gym lord stares.
Then as you head to action, Newton may have something smart to say,
We start movement and motions law along with hope will help us stay.
For the stage of maintenance the lifestyle change needs integration,
Support of growth prevents holes popped in dreams, and their deflation.
In every stage our job is to meet a PERSON where they are,
Help fill the motivation tank, then watch them drive the car.
