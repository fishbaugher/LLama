Both

Everything is fine and nobody is mad.
So how come I feel like I just got caught red handed being bad?
I guess I can shake old ideas up,
See the runneth over in the half full cup,
And try to only really be
Whatever ingredients are actually me
Because there are two of me in here,
One drinks water,one drinks beer
One looks out with curiosity,
One looks in with animosity
I have to frame the world, it's true
But I'll use the ones I got from you.
Because I know I'm good and all,
But I also daily act out the fall
So there's comfort in being completely pathetic
When your makers words can be sympathetic,
Thank you for loving the me that does right,
I can be both this mess and a precious sight.
