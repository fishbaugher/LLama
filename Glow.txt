Glow

I feel caught in Pandoras trap,
No thing but hope to cling to.
No sign of the sun behind the storm,
But just faith that again it'll bring blue.

No space of clarity, no order to this.
It's snakes and lions each way I turn.
Leaves the lesson useless and student blind,
If I live yet leave hope left to learn.

How then do I overcome such sure dread,
That this is just what it is to exist?
That failure inevitably find each innermost soul,
And extinguishes what flicker persists.

I start by doing simple tasks, and well,
Because it shows me that I'm able.
Then learn something new, and cut through
Fear of unknown, like the tower of Babel.

I refuse to be arrogant or resentful,
I choose humility rather than shame.
When shooting the truth like a bullet, at no one
Even I could I righteously aim.

Dirty hands and plank filled eyes have I,
And that's a good thing to know.
But hopes to not let the truth destroy,
That light that Won't shine, but still glows.
