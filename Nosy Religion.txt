Nosy Religion

There is a problem with my vision,
I can only see so much
A big blockage that preventsÂ 
Navigating without a crutch
It causes problems everywhere,
Because it's in the way.
And I simply cannot view like you,
No matter what you say.
It makes it hard to join new groups.
And hard to make new friends.
Hard to study new subjects.
And see new beginnings or old ends.
It makes communication hard,
No conversation flows.
I thought it was religion.
Turns out it's just my nose.
