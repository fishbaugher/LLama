Off to School

Getting teen boys off to school 
Can be a lot of fun.
By fun I mean unruly chaos 
Where nothing but fun is done.
It is directing to a shower
One who is digging through his clothes
While reminding the one in the kitchen
That your mouth is where food goes.
Its assuring boys their hair looks fine
And arranging turn it ins
It's time reminders and hurry ups
And stopping the fidget spins.
It's a car ride full of crazy talk
And girl problems galore
And begging when they wave goodbye
That they completely close the car door.
Its smiling while I'm driving off
Cause they're such joyous little creatures.
And praying that they're attending class
Not hiding beneath the bleachers.
