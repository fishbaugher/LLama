Whoops I made a scarf

I've noticed my own standards are
Created by a power hungry fool
Someone who makes hundreds 
But can't follow just one rule 

A person who ain't showered
For long enough to really stink
Has decided successful people 
Don't have one dish in the sink 

Someone who's got not one
Single clean pair of underwear 
Has decided each drawer can hold
Only things perfectly folded in there 

Someone who has not swept 
The floor since this year's start
Has decided anyone who's trinkets 
Gather dust has fallen apart 

This tyrant in my head is full
Of ideas it finds grand
Ideas that the rest of me 
Just simply cannot stand 

Oh God? My good creator ?
Why do I always want control?
When I know from experience 
It eats alive my soul? 

Take it! you may need use force!
I'm afraid I've again gone insane!
I'll try to hold still long enough 
You can pluck the psycho in my brain
