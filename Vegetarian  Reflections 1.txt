Vegetarian  Reflections 1

I'm trying to figure out animals as pets,
And how they differ from those on my plate.
See, some are my friends, and I'd rather not tell them that it was their mother I ate. 

Others may have a brain to move,
But dont tell me a chicken can love.
This ground dwelling useless fat flightless bird full of meat from above...

Two sets of eyelids they've got for their eyes,
It's disgusting to watch these freaks blink.
I can't help but feel bad for how hard it does look, 
For these boneheads to get a small drink.

I'm sure it is bad to eat humans,
I'm not sure about the others just yet,
So for now until I go talk to some cows,
Chicken is as guilt free as meat gets.
