Brilliant Scientist

I would be a brilliant scientist
If not for the comfort of my robe.
Without the perfect slippers I got
I'd have traveled around the globe.

If my bed was not so soft and warm,
Id have cured malaria and HIV
just like the soothing scents in the infuser 
Prevented me ending poverty

If my coffee didn't need me here
North and South Korea would get along
Thered be no foster kids in hotels
If leaving this pillow wasnt obviously wrong.

If a shower wasnt such hard work
California's freeway system would flow
I could solve global warming, save the seals and the planet with all I know

Yall act like it's so complicated
To ensure both bees and people aren't dead.
I could solve the world's problems no problem
If I could just get out of bed.
