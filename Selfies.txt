Selfies

Look at me, and say I'm pretty
Give me compliments and pity
I want to see some notifications
Lots of positive affirmations.
Look at my hair, I did a thing
All of you my praises sing.
I need you to like the pictures I took
And tell me how fantastic I look
My self esteem is quite unhealthy
That's why I took all these selfies.
