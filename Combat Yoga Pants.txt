Combat Yoga Pants

When I think of resilience it reminds me of elastic
Which keeps me wearing pants when parts of me grow too fatastic
When I expand they stay with me and stretch extremely thin
And when I eat right and exersize they're still pants I fit in.
They are able to move with me without retaining all my woes
And return to equilibrium, cause they're resilient clothes. 
But in a person who is more than pants the metaphor wont do.
Cause eventually the elastic wears and theres nothing you can do.
But humans are like yoga pants that last a hundred years
Each time you stretch them to their limit or stab them with your spears
They do more than return unchanged back to their previous state
But can increase their sturdiness and hold that much more weight
We were made for adversity, which ugly like the toad
Strengthens shoulders wise enough to choose to carry their load
And sets us up to be the yoga pants that change the course we run
And adjust, adapt, and move on till our work on earth is done.
These sturdy yoga pants blaze trails so others find the way
And take what hurt us in days past to use as tools to help today
The machetes that whack sticker bushes and the canteen on our waist 
Were solutions to the problems we were brave enough to face
So you could say these combat yoga pants will outlive me
I'll wear em till I'm all worn out, then let them set someone else free.
Resilience in people is the thing that lives on when we are dead
Which is why, though we look great it them, it wont go to our head
