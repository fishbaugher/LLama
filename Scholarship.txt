Scholarship

Thank you for investing in a future not your own
And moving someone forward that you've never known
I admire faith and hope enough to reach out in that way
To help someone whose desperate to find a way to pay
You've given me a chance to move with purpose through these years
And when I feel defeated and overwhelmed by fears
I'll remember that there was someone else who did believe in me
And I'll honor your free gift by choosing day by day to be
The best that I've got in me, and to always look for good,
And remember when I couldn't hope, there was someone who could.
