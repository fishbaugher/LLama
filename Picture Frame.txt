Picture Frame

Take a picture frame
And hold it arms length from your face.
Imagine all you ever see,
Is confined to just that space.

Imagine nothingness each spot,
That frame is not outlining.
You'll understand sight restricted as such,
Would confuse with its confining.

That frame can only hold so much 
The outline always there.
As if you hold the world in place,
Within that little square.

And if another framer came,
And walked up at an angle,
They'd see your frame as you saw theirs,
And the two of you would tangle.

You could tell them all about their frame,
And they about yours too.
But you'd balk at the idea yours exists,
And carefully filters what you view.

And if the frame was shattered,
You'd be overwhelmed by the size of your sight.
You'd scramble for those frame pieces,
And build another to set it right.

We need a way to view the world,
And a way to measure success.
Or we are aimless sparkly object lovers, 
And that is my optimistic guess.

But at times frames come from others,
We are too blind to resist
They can cripple us into failure,
With seemingly no way to persist.

Make sure you know the frame you hold,
Be sure you know who built it.
Shatter with truth the frames that
Make your soul feel tired or wilted.

The frame makers aren't always good,
But the power is with the holder.
Choose the frames that equal purpose
As the weight upon your shoulder.
