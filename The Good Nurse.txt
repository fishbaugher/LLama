The Good Nurse

There are some ways to be in the world that make my spirit feel awake.
Some ways that serve the least of these and some for my own sake.
It seems not required that i always choose, but when I've got no goal,
My soul has no target to aim at to grow and my impulses gain control.
I've watched how others chose to act and though I often cannot tell
There are many memories of souls pointing up and as many pointed to hell.
Watching makes it clear that choosing behavior patterns is an art.
Colors and canvas in a painter's hands are worth more than the sum of the parts.
I am a life painter picking my colors each time I intentionally act
My behavior improves exponentially as it notices it's being tracked.
When I'm awake and an aiming creature I want truths light to shine through me
I want to remember that I once was blind so I can notice how well I now see.
The ways to be worth the trouble of change are full of meaning and weight.
The ones where others come first and it's not okay to be hurried or late.
The nursing way to be affects countless souls as a blessing or curse.
So I'm certain I only want to do nursing if I am the good kind of nurse.
