House

I'm overwhelmed by the state of my house
Cause I tore it all to peices
I've got projects in every corner if you follow the trail of wrappers of reeses

I'm just eating food and making piles
And trying to make it in to some sense.
But to create order is to give order the bird and let all cleanliness dispense.

I didn't know how much dusting needed doing cause the dust just blends right in.
Till you move the things around and see the clean spots where they've been.

Then dusting tangents take all night,
the sink accumulates evidence I've eaten.
And I walk to get the broom not knowing what I've put my feet in. 

My house is like my soul, if not shaken up often it grows dust on it's decor.
Without regular house keeping it accumulates garbage on the floor.

It has to be cared for or it won't give the shelter it is built to provide.
And a soul, like a house, is supposed to reflect the one that lives inside.
