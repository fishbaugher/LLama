Procrastination is my vocation,
and I excel beyond my peers.
My motivation is on vacation,
And hasn't checked in for years.

I'm like a slug on sleeping drugs,
Half awake and leaving a trail
My coffee mug splatters all the rugs
As I try to walk, but fail.

There's things to do, that require shoes
And that's just too many steps
I'm feeling blue cause my problems grew
With no planning and no preps.

I may be slow, a little crazy
And like the crocodile
If I say soon, just know I'm lazy
And I'll see after a while.
