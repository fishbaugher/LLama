Oops anutha

I can only be as honest as the clarity I've got
God knows that and reveals what I can handle in this spot 

I'm like an onion topped parfait; layers peel off day by day.
I'll keep sanity only when willing to follow A.A's way 

Open-minded to change what God decides to reveal 
Willing to act like my soul can be healed. 

I'm made of bits of chaos, nonsense, courage and hope. 
God gives me each day only what I need to cope 

While my eyes have been fixed on the next step before me
God had restored my life's purpose as if he adores me 

The promises Ive heard in my walk through death's veil
Are the wind to which I can set today's sail 

I'm so grateful to be here, among my family and friends. 
It reminds me I, too, am allowed to be healed and to mend

Personal proverb taken:

The promises I've heard through the veil
Are the winds for today's set of sail
