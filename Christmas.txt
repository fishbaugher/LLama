Christmas

I've gotta make some Christmas stuff,
And deck these drab old halls
Cover the walls and ceilings in paper
And dangling Christmas balls

Throw a wreath on the door
Light up the yard
Bedazzle the tree
And write out these cards

I've gotta be jolly 
And get mistletoe
Find boughs of holly
And materialize snow.

I've gotta buy tons of presents
Until I'm just broke
Laugh unreasonably loud
At each unfunny joke

Make cookies for santa
Leave carrots for crew
And fill up each stocking 
That's not in a shoe

Figure out if I'm naughty
Or made the nice list
And make lists of each thing
All the children have wished

I've gotta make lots of pies
And cranberry sauce
Jingle all of the bells
Like the jingle bell boss

Make sure every sugar cookie
Is beautifully frosted
Then ask st nick for a week off
Cause I'm jingle jolly exhausted.
