Points

In nursing the points are made up of magical dust and thin air
Cause every time I've met a patient, no points were anywhere
In exams for this program all the fears are of failing a test
In patients room my fear is that I cant give then the best.
In class the time is my enemy, and drags on and on and on
With patients I have all the time, but I blink and then it's gone.
In clinicals the other people are distracting and intimidate me
At work when I've shriveled and drooped they're what will reinflate me
And then the day of testing as I rose up from my sleepless bed
i thought of all I'd studied and of what I should have read instead.
I thought I'm not prepared for this, and would not know if I was
I remembered not to panic,
Stupid is as stupid does. 
What's being tested is my ability to apply what I've been taught.
It feels like a test of my value but God promised me its not.
So if I pass or if i fail, or if I straddle the line in between like a bird
To think more than current position measured by the mark would be absurd.
So here I go with pencil, armed with naught but hope and scraps
And ready for this to be over, God knows and is where I'll collapse.
