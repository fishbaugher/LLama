Uremic Frost 

Your blood’s become a garbage bin,
And trash is leaking from your skin.
Your brain cells shrink, you’re feeling weak,
Uremic crystals start to leak,
Creating frost and itchy spots,
Impairing platelets making clots.
You scratch so hard, don’t want to eat,
Immunity and healing both deplete,
If your kidney damage is acute,
You fall faster down this garbage shoot.
Uremic syndrome in CKD
Widespread; increased severity.
But CKD’s onset come later
Higher serum level indicator.
Your risk of problems with your heart,
Come from reduced CO in part.
Also pericarditis, and risk of bleeding,
Time in this state, danger exceeding
You’ve accumulated urea, and so this
Causes metabolic acidosis
You’ve got weakness, some neuropathies
What are options for remedies?
You’ll need garbage truck dialysis.
All because you couldn’t piss.
