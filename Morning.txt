Morning

The morning offers more of the most preciously guarded jewel.
That time we use to build the world,
Or waste it like a fool. 
If someone handed me happiness,
And I had to choose where to spend it,
I'd be my own worst enemy
to use no care to defend it.
But I have it here, in the form of time,
That's not yet oriented to aim.
My happiness and use of this time,
Are two things but require the same.
Happiness is just time spent well,
And satisfaction at my progress in its passing.
It's the difference between bitterness and love
That we spend our lives amassing.
