Campus

I get scared to go on campus
And I can't count the whys
I know it has to do with people
And also with their eyes

It has to do with conciousness 
That sinks inside of me.
As I imagine from my spot
What a murderous gunman would see.

It has to do with confident ignorance
And a lack of out loud questions.
And teachers who seem nervous 
Merely making sweet suggestions.

It has to do with noise and lights
And input I can't control
It has to do with fear of accidentally
Destroying my own soul

It has to do with wondering
What it actually means to succeed
And not just mule after dangling carrots
Driven on by my unconscious greed.

It has to do wth being scared
That I'm actually wasted potential.
But I'll face all those fears and look to the sky
Everything encrementals eventual.
