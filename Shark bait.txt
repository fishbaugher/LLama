Shark bait

There once was a boat that sailed out to sea
Appearing to represent all that is free
It floated along the waves of deep blue
Just listen up, because the captain was you.

The boat was so beautiful, crew was so sweet
Except they forgot to bring something to eat
The days grew much longer and with each passing morn
The crew went from sad to distraught and forlorn.

They looked to their captain, the wise noble Mark
Who decided they'd live by dining on shark
They'd nothing to use for bait in the water
So Mark chased his wife and of course promptly caught her 

And he said "my sweet
To have something to eat
You must put your feet in the sea.
And I'll reel you back in, when I see a fin, just, my reflexes say trust in me.

So she dangled the toes in hope of a meal
And when the shark came shrieked out "REEL! REEL! REEL!"
But mark was asleep on the deck.
There was a great meal, though for one unintended, 
When vows break like that there's no hope they'll be mended.
It ate her clear up to her neck.

The reason I'm telling this gruesome short tale
Is that I can't reach you except this or the mail
And I want to remind you before you set out
That food is gold cargo you can't leave without.
