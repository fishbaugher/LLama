The big skinny US

If Energy intake and output
Match up in us to create health.
Then why, in the US, is skinny 
Associated with piles of wealth?

It doesnt make sense if money
Is what's used at the grocery store
That slender folks have visible bones
And obesity reins in the poor.

Impulse control can be factored in
But back to the shopping cart
Poor are more likely to eat at mcD's
While rich turn the cooking to art

So I've got to think there is more at play
When we sit down to eat a good meal
It must not just have to do with the food
But be connected to how eaters feel.

Time can be spent in the kitchen
Time watched is a measurers fool 
Time can be spent and stolen and lost
Time's both dignifying and cruel.

Time is more expensive as you grow rich
And the worth of each minute grows
But comparing the waist of income levels
Leaves me wondering just where it shows.

The rich would be fat and the poor would be lean
If riches bought sustenance here
So poor man's problems including such girth
Seems to make that logic disappear

What then measures growth of the girth?
As you grow rich and lean side by side
Does the money grow and you shrink
As do the rules by which you abide? 

Do you make a rule in the kitchen
For each extra dollar you make?
Does an income bracket change require
You eat lettuce in place of your cake?

Does your health care improve
And advice become higher
To match the ideals
Of the high income buyer?

Or is it simply a matter of pleasure to you
When your life and finances complicate,
To stop the busy for just long enough
To have a hand in what you just ate.

I have said many things without really saying
What I'd conclude from all this and that.
But if you're from elsewhere and struggling to eat,
Come to the states where the poor folks are fat.
