Macrolides

Are you coughing, are your lungs full
Or did you get an STI?
Don’t worry, you’ll just get prescribed
Bacteriostatic macrolides
They’ll bind to ribosomal receptors
Protein synthesis will stop
And you’ll be rushing to the toilet
For a squirt and not a plop.
If your ECG shows QT prolongation
This’ll make you quickly die
It’ll help treat CDIFF if other antibiotics make
Your risk of it so high.
We’ll put in your IV slow so
Your veins aren’t irritated
Or give a zpack for the chlamydia
From that Tinder guy you dated
Take it hours after food or antacids
For the best absorption rate
And if its sexually transmitted, tell
Your mom it’s what you ate.
