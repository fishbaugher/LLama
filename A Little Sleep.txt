A Little Sleep

It's not that I'm uninterested,
You're far from unentertaining.
But I have no idea where we're at,
Or how much still remains of explaining.

I'm feeling like we're nearing a question,
Or approaching a definitive topic.
But your imagination spans countrysides,
And my patience has become microscopic.

I'm so thrilled you're talking so openly,
It's so untimely, oh the hours I keep.
I guess that loving a lot of people
Means you only get a little of sleep.
