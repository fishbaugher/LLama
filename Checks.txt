Checks

I've written checks for rent and did not feel my pencil dancing.
I've written to pay property taxes and felt no sense of romancing.
Ive written them for school lunches and I felt no sense of control
I've written them for toilet paper and it did not fill up my soul.
I was tjinking checks were never written to make the writer complete. 
This was before I got invited to write one for cookies I can eat
