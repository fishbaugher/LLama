Dirty Deeds, Not so Cheap

It takes the love from a mother's child
And turns it to lies and deciet.
It takes every ambition your heart ever knew
And turns it to hopeless defeat

It takes your wandering spark of intellect
And turns it to single minded hell
It takes the best friend you've ever had
To the one you steal from to sell


It takes your mother, who gave you your life
And ages her ten years in one.
It turns the father who taught you what's right
To the one who tells you hes done

It takes the time allotted you in the world
And empties it into the dirt
It takes what could have been connection
Turns it to endless shame and hurt

It takes the heart that beats your blood
Through your body to keep you alive
And makes it your nightmare each time it pumps
Devoid of the will to survive

It takes each hand reached out in love
And turns it to chances to score
As it eats away everything you care about
Yet somehow is still hungry for more.

It beckons promising with black souless eyes
That your problems can be cast away
All you need is just one more last high
There's just agonized hell to pay

It tells you it doesnt matter any more
And neither do you now or ever
And tells you the ideas of destruction you have
Are of course right, cause aren't you so clever?

And when your humanity lies wasted and dead
And the shell left lies bloody and broken
You'll know then, when it is too late for hope
That it was the devil who'd spoken.
