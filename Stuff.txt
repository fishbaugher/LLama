Stuff

I get a house and have a car, 
And look at all my stuff.
And realize the problem is
I just dont have enough.

The home is made inside the house
You know what I mean.
Without the stuff to dirty it
There's no stuff for me to clean.

If I'm lucky enough,Stuff accumulates
and through the passing time,
I'll have to get a bigger house
To fit all of what is mine.

And when I meet a new friend
They'll look at all my things,
My trinkets and my couches,
My carpets and my rings

And they'll see my stuff here
Is of value most the same
As all the stuff in the world
They've marked with their name

And so we can be friends
And not have to fret
That we've sought out the friendship
For what we can get.

We complain of our things 
That aren't working right,
Show off all our new stuff
So proud of the sight.

And time will be measured 
By stuff we collected,
Old things treasured most 
With memories resurrected

Of getting the stuff while we
Were so fresh and new,
And if I really love you,
I'll give stuff to you.

I'll grow older and older,
the clock nibbles down,
And after enough time,
I wont be around.

But my stuff will still be here,
I've done that for you,
So that after the funeral 
You've got something to do.

As you pack up my pieces
Let a tear or two spill 
Just dont break my stuff
On your way to goodwill.
