Tia Bug

My childhood's littlest love and joy 
The one who shed my blinders
The one who was worth seeing for
With all pains stark reminders 

The one who's life I hoped for 
When mine had gone to hell
Who's future mattered more'n mine
Whose story I still tell 

The little girl who's hair I cut, 
Whose school clothes I arranged 
Who brought me back to clarity 
When I'd become deranged 

Grew up to be the softest place 
I found to land my sorrow 
Who was assured to be there
In my every next tomorrow 

The smartest brain I've ever known 
Whose heart is not a stone 
Who came aside and comforted
When I was all alone 

I am shit with writing cards 
Cause feelings are enormous 
I'm just so glad you'll be with me
Through all that lays before us
