Morning Again

Is it morning again?
I cant say, its december.
Isn't there a sunrise?
I just cant remember.

I have coffee here made,
A signal of day.
But since I'm the maker of such,
I really cant say.

The cats were tail flicking
In front of the door.
Them going outside,
Is one signal more.

My teen is asleep,
But that doesnt mean much.
They're perpetually awake,
Using sleep as a crutch.

I'm in need of a shower,
And haven't worked out.
That's one thing I know
That Mornings about.

I've not been to work yet, 
And soon I must go.
But does this signal morning?
I have to say no.

I've made the bed up 
Just as coffee was made,
And the alarm clock did ring,
Till my attention was paid.

I suppose I cant know 
If the day has begun,
So in case yes, I'll pretend,
Until I see some sun.
