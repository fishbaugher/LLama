Limits of Me

I have a life to live whether I choose to live or not.
I can divide or multiply what I give and what I've got.
I can be thankful and look up, and see what's good to see.
Or curse the ground as I look down despising the limits of me.
I can accept my flaws, and not be discouraged they exist.
I can see small improvement as a justification to persist.
I can wallow in the suffering that existence carries in it,
Or find a purpose to aim at that is high enough to begin it.
Each person alive is a chance to bring forth the best there is to be.
Only if I'm not stuck in my head can it then be from me.
