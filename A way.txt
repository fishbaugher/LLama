A way

A terrible truth is it's own remedy
When spoken aloud with precision.
But we hold them inside, like we've already died,
Or say we've not lied, just done PC revision.

To say a thing that hasn't been said,
Or that's controversial, or bleak; yet true;
Moves the darkness outside the space it took up,
On the vulnerable framing we do.

True things, and genuinely new ideas,
Can be chaotic to bring into being.
What words to use, how to bravely set forth,
And cut order so others are seeing

Brings nearby truth seekers, lights in hand,
To the darkness you thought would destroy you.
While we shine together in the darkest corners,
Everyone, even you, can enjoy you.

Don't shy from truths that don't make sense,
Or the ones no one's willing to say.
For to do that could cause all the goodness in you,
To die with you, so be brave, find a way.
