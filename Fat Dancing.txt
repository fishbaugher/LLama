Fat Dancing

Being fat does not make life less worth while for living.
It does make efforts in all ways more costly for the giving.
I still play,dance and run around, and love people a lot
But I'm more apt to pack snacks and I sweat when it's not hot. 

I try to do some stretching and feel just like a seal
Who flops and flips on solid ground, only roused by the next meal.
My chins surround my face and when I smile so do they
And I can barely reach my palms together when I pray.

My shoes wear out more quickly cause I pound them near to dead.
But all my skinny headbands still fit around my head.
I have to watch where I sit down cause if it is too low
It will be impossible to stand next time I try to go

Criss cross applesauce is more like crispy apple fritter
And you'd better think twice before you let me be your baby sitter.
Poor child would die as I sat on them, they'd never have a chance.
Plus i cant even reach my feet so i can't put on pants.

I snore now when i sleep cause my poor lungs must have each breath.
And when I climb up stairs my heart is beating near to death.
I have so many more problems now that I've gained so much weight.
But still I think it would be silly to decide it's me I hate.

I like me even in this suit of lard I've donned this year
And though I struggle more I am not full of social pressure fear 
If I've got people in my life who like me only when I'm thin
I'll go ahead and bake them up, grab my fork and just dig in.
