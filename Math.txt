Math; not even once

Math and all its problems turn my brain into a stew.
I know a lot of things except which thing that I should do.
I find an answer, then find out no part of it is true.
I use pages on what's simple that I accidentally grew.

I sit and try to concentrate, and formulate a plan.
To appear a bit less clueless than I was when I began.
Find answers, not just multiply scored shots in the trash can.
They're almost as numerous as the glitches in my attention span.

So I guess I'll just look studious, and try to be on time.
Examine my successful peers and imitate them like mime.
Try to sound coherent, when up in class I chime.
And take comfort in the fact that at least my brain can rhyme.
