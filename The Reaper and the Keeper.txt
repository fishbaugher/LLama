The Reaper and the Keeper

Death is very scary when it's new or far away
The smell is nasty and the persons skin is cold and gray
If you're not used to seeing it, it can be intimidating 
One barely breathing and your job is now to keep sedating
You see how death can be so rushed, without time for goodbye
And see that it can drag so long that life's what makes you cry
But if you get close and stay there you'll see it is not decided
That when the spark goes out and you last close your lifeless eyelid
That hell is there to meet like it could be every place.
Even then, you can choose him and your death can be in grace.
