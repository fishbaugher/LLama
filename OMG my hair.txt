OMG my hair

We seem to be a little obsessed 
With the dead stuff that grows from our head.
We like to purchase then place products,
Give em highlights or lowlights instead.

We have spray and goo and leave it in,
Straightening, curling, frizz ease,
We can comb it and brush it and wash it too,
Braid, pin it, bun it, or tease.

The products at the store, once one isle,
Have expanded as time has gone by.
Now we wander among multiple hair stuff rows,
Purchasing items and not asking why.

Did the needs of hair become so much more?
Or have we all been commercialized?
Perhaps it's not so much space in the store,
As our egos that are needing resized.
