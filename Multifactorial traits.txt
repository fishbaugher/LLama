Multifactorial traits

If I love heroin, but it isn't my fault,
I'll just blame it on my genetics.
I could probably even blame my genes,
If im fat and suck at athletics.

If I talk to people who aren't there, 
And love dabbling in psychosis,
Or have mood disorders with buffoon like behaviors,
I've probably been like that since meiosis.

It's time to stand up to this quackery science,
Saying you can have a Multifactorial Trait.
If for a second I acknowledge that bit,
I'm out all excuses for my diet and weight.

I think heritability math is all wrong,
Weighing both environmental and genetic variance.
Cause I know that my insomnia,
Is entirely the fault of my parents.

I think I'll just fix what science got wrong,
To explain my anorexic like hunger strike.
My genes are responsible for anything that's bad,
And I'll take the blame for the things that I like.
