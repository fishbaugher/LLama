Candles

Over the purple mountains 
Beyond the silver sea 
Between the sparkling rocks of time 
There's so much more to life than me 

When I can't see you anymore 
Or hear your easy laughter 
When memories are all that's left 
Until we meet in ever after 

I'll know, though gone, you're still alive 
As I'll hold you in each day
I'll feel your presence there with me
Though your body's long been away 

Know the life you've lived  will live on 
Investments made will still return 
You'll surely leave this place for good 
But this candle you flamed will still burn
