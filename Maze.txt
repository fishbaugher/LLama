Maze

Heart beat, warm feet, reactant to light and sound.
It would seem that telling signs of life are all around.
Smiling mouth, laughing tongue, eyes focused and alight,
Tells nothing of perceptions on the brain as part of sight.
A circuit built can be used again,
Just close your eyes and do it.
You pull images to your cerebral screen,
There's really nothing to it.
What is sight? Just seeing things? 
Are the things necessary at all?
A thing is small if you are large,
And large if you are small.
Depending on perception for thorough instruction,
Invites constant value reconstruction.
There need to be dependable facts.
Foreseeable consequences connected to acts.
There has to be order enough for our brain,
To steer our meat suit in a way that is sane. 
Value structuring, framing, and differentiation,
Allow partial sense, not complete disorientation.
So that you've got a target to focus your gaze,
And purposely trudge througthrough this lifelike maze.
