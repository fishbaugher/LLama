In His Shade

I feel like humans need to sweat
Before they try to think.
They need to get to and past
Their own last ditch effort brink.

They must know they're inadequate 
And have less than is required.
That if the universe was theirs to run
Even they would want them fired.

Brains and thoughts are tantalizing 
Seeming not to require evidence
The thinker sure the thoughts and them
Can breed only benevolence 

But thoughts and thinkers are not made
Of stuff so pure and good
They both stray far from righteousness
And do not do what they should.

It is a gift from god that we can take
A new perspective with our brain.
The gift is best used by the folks
Who are aware that they're insane.

Our efforts make us hot and smelly
And we need to take a shower.
Only god wont need deodorant 
When he's exerted all his power.

So perhaps us people need to toil
And remember we are made.
By one strong enough to stand tall
While we rehydrate in his shade.
