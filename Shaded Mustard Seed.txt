Shaded Mustard Seed

Damn it feels like winter
From my heart into my soul.
It feels like all things dark and cold
Are truly in control.

It feels like lifting boulders
To get up out of bed.
Half baked truth and half 
Told lies are feeding and are fed.

Rain and wet and dismal
Is the day and is the view.
Dreams took wing and flight
And threw me off and all askew.

Phantom thoughts of decent days
Bring pain as much as pleasure.
I'd rather just not think of them,
It soils the things I treasure.

I see the things at once I laughed
And feel no thing at all.
The surface shows no sign
Of what is so diminished and small.

I know how to see the good in things
I've practiced all these years
I tell myself to look for them
It's just that no one hears.
