Trained Insane

I just love training new employees
She said with a sarcastic grin.
All the joy of last night will
Tonight be repeated again

I'm the best teacher ever
She said, eyes and fingers crossed
There isn't anyone new here
That I couldn't help get lost

I wonder what the boss thought
When he prescribed me to you.
To have deserved such punishment
My God, what did you do?

So i watch you suspiciously
Sure this is some cruel trick
And if you feel me staring
I look away, get busy quick

I'm not sure you can do this job
But this i know for sure
If your destined to be best at it
My training is the cure.
