Love Is

Love is when I'm tired but refuse to go to bed.
So you watch dumb documentaries all night with me instead.
It arrives in notes and packages left at my front door.
In lotion from my mama when my hands are cracked and sore.
It sits in someone's living room and covers me when I nap.
And when I hold a baby then it sits upon my lap.
It has a thousand arms and every one of them stretched out.
To hold me and to show me I'm someone they care about.
