Kind

I ask you why you Do what you do
Why you choose always to be kind.
Why when looking at people you actually see,
With your ears, eyes, compassion, and mind.

You hold up the values that live in my soul,
So I'm not maladaptive and confused,
And every time I leave where you are,
I've restored all the hope that I'd used.

Thank you for wisdom, guidance, and hope
And for acting out the truth,
For sacrificing so many todays
Investing in our future and youth.
