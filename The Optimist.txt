The Optimist

The rain falls in music on the tin roof of my home.
It brings me back inside it as my mind begins to roam.
The roof between the rain and I prevents me getting wet.
What roof can give the protection of peace from all the causes of upset?
The rain still pours, the roof does not just keep me dry,
It makes a joyful noise as it is beaten from the sky.
To have a roof is a simple blessing that no one would deny,
And even a leaky roof prevents much moisture with its try.
The goodness I can manifest needs shelter from the storm,
Not avoidance of the cold, but in it, ways to keep it warm.
The savior is an old idea, sort of like the roof and rain.
Its purpose to the struggle, not protection from the pain.
The rain will come, and the roof will leak, and I wont be enough.
The pain will permeate the air and call my every bluff.
I'll see the roof that leaks as part of a story lasting more
Than the time it takes for those raindrops to puddle on the floor.
The roof that lives inside determines where my eyes will land
It sees the impossibility in the way I've prepped and planned,
And celebrates the plans that flourish, absorbing what is good,
And faces the plans that fail by helping me do what I should.
It tries to keep my thoughts from wet, and all the mold and rot,
And when those drops convince me that I'm hopeless when I'm not,
That shelter stands unflinching, waiting for my gaze,
To see that I'm not carelessly planted in an impossible maze.
To see that in the rained in room, wet and full of despair 
There's really just one dripping spot, it's mostly dry in there.
