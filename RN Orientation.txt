RN Orientation

I'm getting ready for orientation
Cause I got accepted to learn to RN
So far I've learned I'm socially weird
And to always carry a pen

I've learned mmr vaccines may need
A booster after some years
And that squeamish with shots or needles
Can't be one of my fears

I've learned that business casual
Is a dress code, though I'm still unsure
So I just googled a bunch of pictures
And did my best from there to infer

I've learned I'm not now a criminal, but
If murder is one of my future wishes
That some old ladies' fingerprints wear off
Cause they did so many dishes.

I've learned hot glue guns are terrible tools
For costumes involving foam
But toothpicks work just fine in a pinch
Thank God I had some at home.

I've learned that when you're in CPR class
The baby dummies require much care.
Cause their heads pop off really easily
And they dont come with a spare.

I've learned that I dont know many things
And it's better not to pretend.
It's probably fine to be foolish as I set out
As long as I'm not at the end.

And then the first day of orientation came
Where I learned bed pan frisbee skills
And that if an old lady refuses them
You shouldn't take her pills

We learned which clinical groups we're in
And how to play yardzee
And how if you don't speak up and say it
You'll never get to go pee

We met a big dancing riverhawk
Who didn't have a real face
And that when posing for group photos
We disregard personal space.

We learned when we're ordering clothes to plan for expansion of girth
And that in simulation lab we may 
witness robotic birth.

I've learned I'm not the only one
A little shaky and scared,
To be like lion king hyenas
Marching and being prepared.
