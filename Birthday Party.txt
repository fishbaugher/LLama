Birthday Party

A birthday party for a baby
Who has just turned one.
Is a place for remembering 
What it was to have fun.

Before we learn the rules
And before we could abide
Life was not a planned out trek
But a wild carnival ride.

Before you start expecting things,
Before you can sit still
Before the intellect learns to overpower
Your humanity and your will

L.L. Ama
