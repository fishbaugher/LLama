Today begins another term,
Of filling the tentacled beast.
I'll take it to my Spanish class
And feed it a foreign feast.

I'll log it in to canvas,
And allow it to look around.
And then I can walk the meat suit,
While it marvels at what it there found.

I shall read it classic literature,
And teach it human nutrition.
Set it on scientific truth
Ignore its proclivity to superstition.

I will be a brain and a body too,
School entertains in a purposeful way.
Looking at interesting pieces of truth,
Like that the future begins today.
